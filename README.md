# note

Regarding to task, the use of for loop and the slice function has a major factor to the final outcome. The for loop indicate the number of group array elements needed based on the looping statement.

The groupArrayElements function must return an array of length greater than zero and a positive integer, otherwise, the outcome will return an empty array. When the array of length is greater than zero along with a positive integer. So the slice() function is used to to get each group array based on the start and end index, then push each group array into groupArray variable to return the final result.

I will be delighted to explain it more in details on the phone or zoom, etc...
